> **Abstract:** In this paper, we present MDS_Writer_, a novel open-source annotation tool for creating multi-document summarization corpora. A major innovation of our tool is that we divide the complex summarization task into multiple steps which enables us to efficiently guide the annotators and to record all their intermediate results and userâ€“system interaction data. This allows evaluating the individual components of a complex summarization system and learning from the human composition process. MDS_Writer_ is highly flexible and can be adapted to multiple other tasks.
